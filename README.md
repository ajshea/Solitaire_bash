<h1> The Solitaire Encryption Algorithm in Bash </h1>

This is Bruce Schneier Solitaire's Encryption Algorithm coded in bash. For portability and efficiency purposes, I only use bash internal commands to write this script. 
I have tested it in several operating systems such as Linux debian/Ubuntu, Mac OSX 10.6.8, and even in Windows with Cygwin (in order to port bash).

<h4>About Solitaire Algorithm (From schneier.com)</h4>

In Neal Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon, the character Enoch Root describes a cryptosystem code-named "Pontifex" to another character named Randy Waterhouse, and later reveals that the steps of the algorithm are intended to be carried out using a deck of playing cards. These two characters go on to exchange several encrypted messages using this system. The system is called "Solitaire" (in the novel, "Pontifex" is a code name intended to temporarily conceal the fact that it employs a deck of cards) and It was designed to allow field agents to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools. An agent might be in a situation where he just does not have access to a computer, or may be prosecuted if he has tools for secret communication.
